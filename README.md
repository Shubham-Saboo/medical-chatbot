# README: RAG enabled Medical Chatbot

I built a smart Medical Chatbot that uses Retrieval Augmented Generation using open-source tools. We'll use Langchain for building RAG pipeline, HuggingFace for embeddings, Faiss CPU for vector storage, and Mistral with Streamlit for a conversational interface.

## Steps to Set Up the Environment

### Install Required Packages
Run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
pip install langchain langchain_community langchain_huggingface faiss-cpu pypdf
pip install huggingface_hub
pip install streamlit
